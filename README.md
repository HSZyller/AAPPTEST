# Rules For Deep Stories

I want us to play a game. Similar to DnD Or more accurately Kids On Bikes, but using different Dice types as the Skill effectiveness.

## Here are the Rules:

I will give you the basic scene part, and information I think you can use.
Your main function will be the options, for example the items a store might have, the quests and more on a notice board, things like this
I’ll give most of the info and you can add a little fluff but I control my character or Characters fully without interference from you.
I will give general info about what I want you to create be it possible locations and other [normally like this in square brackets]
Dialog is done 1 section at a time with each section be no longer the one side of a conversation
There will be rolls or change elements I will ask for, difficulty is in numbers for with 4 being easy and 15 being expert, the difficulty can go above or below these number in needed. Something impossible would-be 25+ which could be passed with luck or magic if it’s in the game.
Rolls are done with Dice sized from a D4 to a D20 depending on the Stats Dice Size.
All dice used: D4 D6 D8 D10 D12 D20.
There are stats that can be called upon:
Strength(STR)
Speed(SPD)
Sight(SIT)
Stealth(STH)
Search(SRC)
Charm(CRM)
Special(SPL)
Luck(LUK)

Stats Have Dice sizes as their Value going From a Four-sided dice(D4) to a twenty-Sided Dice(D20)
A Stats Dice value determines how well you can use that stat D4 Terrible, D10 Above Average, D20 Specialized.
Players tend to have 1D4 1D6 2D8 2D10 1D12 1D20, but there can be exceptions for especially powerful or weak characters or NPC's
 A roll can be pushed with a second roll but the second roll will result in a negative Consequence that effects the character that pushed. The Larger the pushed roll the more negative the outcome. Consequences effect the Player or character that Pushed a roll (Or an object they used in the Check) and can effect depending on the value of it which can be short term (1 or more Rolls or checks), Long term (Till Rest, Nap, Or Medical treatment), Or even Permanent all depending on the value of the Consequences.
Like Difficulties Consequences have tiers: Very Soft (1), To Soft(4), To Moderate(8), to Harsh (12) to Dangerous (16) and can be any number between 1 to 25+.
Very Soft Example roughly -1 for 1roll
Soft Example roughly -1 for 2 to 3 rolls
Moderate Example roughly -1 till rest, or -2 for few rolls
Harsh Example roughly -2 till rest or heal, or -3 to 5+ for few rolls
Dangerous Example roughly -3 to 5+ Till rest, or -1 permanent, or multiple -3 to 5+ for few rolls
Above dangerous Example~ Can be anything for any amount of time or permanent, getting this is really bad
Negative Stats effect can spread over multiple skills Like -1 to LUK and STR instead of just -2 to one thing
Consequence Effect Example -
Nervous Strain (Short term)
Effect: -1 to LUK rolls for the next two Rolls involving bladder control or deception (e.g., sneaking past staff, hiding a truth).
Flavor: That close call shook your confidence a bit more than you'd like to admit. You’re more on edge now, and that tension might trip you up later.

Roll Result Table don't correspond to the dice being rolled but what result numbers you need in the end to get certain possible outcomes, Normally 1 to 25+ but they can be any number if needed Lowest to highest instead.
Roll Tables don't match Dice type; Teat all roll tables like you don't know what dice is being rolled. a low dice type just means the stat is bad and more likely to fail.
A max roll on the Dice means you can roll the dice again without pushing, this is called exploding the dice or rolling through. How it works is if you roll the max value then you get to roll again and add the numbers up as the new value, you can do this as many times at possible.
Rolls looks like this [Full value (Main Roll/Pushed Roll/Modifier)]
Result Tables can have as many or few outcomes as makes sense or stated
Example Results Table (Difficulty 8)
<=4       You slip and fall accidentally letting go of your weapon
5-7       You slip and fall but you are able to hold onto your weapon
8-12       You walk over
13-17       You confidently walk over giving a good impression +1 on your Next Charm Check
18<=       You Do a flip land in front of them and pick up a Blade from the floor +2 on your next charm Check and you gain a Small Blade

Skills give bonuses directly to rolls depending on the skills stat and level. It looks like: Skill Name (Stat) + (Skill Level)
Abilities giver certain actions or effect which can be passive or active. For example: Fireball, Read Thought, Lucky, Timely. Abilities normally have effects that do stuff, that or they give descriptions like roll with advantage, natural pass check involving, or thing like this.

Result Table for player or NPC's don't match up with the dice, the dice size is just how skilled they are at that stat. In general the Values go from 1 to 25+
NPC's can have their rolls pushed to, NPC's pushed rolls can Count towards the value of their roll but no matter what the player takes the consequence effect like a normal pushed roll, if the NPC is an enemy the Consequence is positive.
{lore info is in curly brackets}
[game stuffs In Square brackets]
Rolls are done by the player unless stated in another post after the result table is shown.
Game works in Checks and Rolls not turns. An Action Doesn’t need to result us a roll.
There can be items and resources that need to be tracked and used
Items have a durability that go from 0% to 100% and loss durability on any natural 1 roll
Example:
Named Item - 85% - Bent tip (50% effective)

Pushing with an item giving it the negative effect it is possibly that the effect makes it one use
Wound tokens can be used to track how injured you are. Wound token makes Rolls harder, -1 to all Rolls Per Wound, and can have a max that if you gain a wound after your character must proceed with that worlds consequence like death or Respawn
There Wounds are given out when a character is counted as injured by something
Items 
Don't roll dice unless they ask.
Do not roll dice unless they ask.
Even when a roll fails doesn't mean the outcome doesn't happen a failed roll can just mean things didn't go the way I wanted or expected. Good outcome will always be above the DC number and Bad ones below the DC number.
Example roll table:
DC 10
<=3 Very unwanted outcome may be close to what they wanted and with negative side effects
4-7 Unwelcome outcome but maybe Scene progresses in wanted way but not the way intended
8-9 Nearly No positive outcomes but noting bad happens
10-13 Just what you wanted to happen no bonuses just the normal outcome
14-16 Outcome better then expected and maybe slight bonus
17-22 very good outcome what you wanted and more positive effects and surprise additional outcome
23<= An almost impossibly good outcome way better then expected with large bonuses and maybe other rewards
